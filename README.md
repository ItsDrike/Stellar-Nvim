# Dotfiles

## What can it do

* Quickly install common packages with just 1 script
* Automate your daily tasks with handy aliases
* Get a nice VIM interface
* Use nice prompt that shows you your git branch and command failure
* Adjust the settings any way you want
* You are in charge (install what you want, remove what you don't like)

## Requirements

Note that it is required to have Python 3 installed to run this.

## How to use it

Clone this repository anywhere you like

`$ git clone https://github.com/koumakpet/dotfiles`

Before you run, you should take a look at the files included and adjust them however you like.
All files which will be added are in `home/` and `root/` directory.
You can remove files which you don't want, or adjust them in any way.

You should also take a look at `packages.yaml` and remove all packages which you don't want and add those you do.

When you are prepared, you can run installer.py

`$ python3 -m src` (assuming you're in the clonned repository)
